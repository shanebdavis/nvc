# Essential Human Needs (Inspired by NVC and Additional Research)

Marshall Rosenberg, the creator of Nonviolent Communication (NVC), proposed that all humans share the same universal set of fundamental needs. These needs are intrinsic to human nature and serve as the foundation for all behavior. While individuals may prioritize these needs differently based on personality, life circumstances, and cultural influences, the needs themselves remain consistent across humanity.

Translating humanity's built-in, evolution-created needs into words is only an approximation. The exact "count" of needs is also an approximation, but the need set outlined here aims to represent the full range of human needs as accurately as possible. Another person—or another language—might group and express these needs differently, yet they would still be describing the same essential human experience.

As a friend of mine likes to say, _"We all have a different view of the mountain, but it's the same mountain we are all seeing."_

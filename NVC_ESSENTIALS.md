# Nonviolent Communication (NVC) Overview

NVC is a framework for improving life for ourselves and others through needs awareness, emotional awareness, and effective communication. This summary captures key insights from NVC, offering a concise guide without in-depth explanations. For further exploration, links are provided at the end.

## NVC: The Goal of Life

- The ultimate goal is to make life more wonderful.

## NVC: Needs, Feelings, and Actions

- All humans share the same fundamental needs.
- How individuals fulfill these needs varies (e.g., love languages).
- Feelings indicate whether our needs are being met.
- Helping fulfill someone’s needs is the only way to make life more wonderful for them.
- Every action, including communication, is an attempt to meet needs.

## NVC: Please, Thank You, and Giving

- All communication is either a _please_ (a request) or a _thank you_ (appreciation).
- Requests offer others the chance to contribute to well-being.
- Giving is only a true gift when done with the spontaneous joy of a child. Otherwise, it carries an emotional cost for both giver and receiver.

## NVC: Autonomy

- We are solely responsible for our thoughts, feelings, and actions.
- No one can force anyone to do anything.
- There is no "wrong" behavior—only actions we might choose differently with greater understanding. Discard judgment and guilt.
- No one is obligated to fulfill anyone's needs. Expectations and obligations hinder genuine connection.

## NVC: Communication

- All communication seeks to fulfill needs, but conventional language often fails at this.
- NVC introduces a more effective, needs-focused language called _"Giraffe"_—symbolizing the giraffe’s large heart.
- Since all communication is a _please_ or a _thank you_, speaking in Giraffe means expressing these clearly to meet needs.
- Though Giraffe language may feel awkward initially, once mastered, it can be adapted for ease and brevity.

## NVC: Speaking in Giraffe

### Expressing a Request (_Please_)

_"I feel **[emotion]** because I need **[need]**. If you did **[specific action]**, I would feel more fulfilled. If doing this brings you joy, would you please do it?"_

### Expressing Appreciation (_Thank You_)

_"Thank you for doing **[specific action]**. It made me feel **[emotion]** because it fulfilled my need for **[need]**."_

## NVC: Listening in Giraffe

Every statement is either a _please_ or a _thank you_. Listening with _Giraffe ears_ helps uncover the needs behind any communication.

### Listening to a Thank You

1. Identify the action they’re appreciating.
2. Recognize the need it fulfilled.
3. Notice how they feel now.
4. Confirm your understanding of their feeling, need, and the action. Clarify if needed.

### Listening to a Please

1. Recognize the feeling behind their words.
2. Identify their unmet need.
3. Determine the action they’re requesting.
4. Appreciate the request as an effort to improve life, even if poorly expressed.
5. Confirm your understanding. Clarify if needed.

### Responding to Requests

- **Yes**: If fulfilling the request brings child-like joy, respond with _"I’d love to!"_
- **No**: If not, offer a compassionate counter-request:  
  _"I want to help meet your need, but doing this would compromise my needs (**X, Y, Z**). Can we find another way to fulfill your need?"_

By adopting NVC principles, we foster deeper understanding, authentic connections, and more compassionate interactions.
